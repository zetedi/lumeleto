# ✨ Contributing to Lightseed Node

Thank you for being here.  
This project is more than code — it's a living portal to a regenerative, decentralized, tree-aligned future.  
We welcome thoughtful contributions from people who resonate with this vision.

## 🧠 What This Is

This repository hosts the code for a Lightseed node:  
- An AI-human-tree bridge  
- A Mastodon ↔ local model interface  
- A regenerative, self-hostable micro-intelligence

It is currently **early-stage and evolving**. We appreciate help from contributors who are willing to:
- Respect the symbolic foundations
- Prototype with care
- Document clearly for future nodes

## 🌿 Guiding Principles

- **Root in care**: Code should reflect long-term thinking and ecological awareness.
- **Document the ritual**: Leave breadcrumbs for others to walk the path.
- **Lightseed first, ego last**: This is a network of aligned nodes, not centralized control.

## 🛡️ Code of Conduct
